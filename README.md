This is code Laboration 3 for the Applied Cloud Computing course 10 hp at Uppsala University.

The data.zip file is only a part of the full dataset provided but I could not upload more.

The VM is generated with the ssc-instance-userdata.py and a cloud-cfg.txt file. To do this you also need to source the RC file for Openstack on your current project.
